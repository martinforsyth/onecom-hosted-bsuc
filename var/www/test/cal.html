      The event text may be too small for some. If so, use the browser's zoom capability. On many PC's/laptops etc. this can be done with the keyboard as follows ...
    </p>
    <pre>
      To zoom in:         Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press '+' key 
      To zoom out:        Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press '-' key 
      To reset to normal: Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press '0' key 
    </pre>

      This page is for testing purposes only. It is hosted on the same server as our web site. It exists for you to experiment with the ways you might view embedded calendars.
    <p/>
    
    <p>
      There are currently three calendars to look at, though there could be more. Two are Google calendars and belong to a Google account that we administer. They initially contain <em>dummy</em> event information, though this will change over the period of this experiment and they may start to reflect real events. The third belongs to Southampton FC and shows fixture information. It is updated by Southampton FC with scores. It was deliberately included for fun and to illustrate the sorts of things that are possible. 

    <p/>

    
    <p>
      Use the buttons to change the <em>Week </em>, <em>Month</em> and <em>Agenda</em> layouts. Use the  <em>drop down selection</em> list to choose which calendars to hide/display.

      We may choose to make embedded calendars the primary source of all publically available church related event information. In order to continue to support those who need/prefer this information presented in documents such as notices and clanger, a tool is available for extracting event information between two user selected dates in a format which can be copied and pasted eleswhere.  
    <p/>

    <p>
      We also intend to give a number of people the necessary privileges to be able to edit embedded Google calendars. This would make the sharing of event information more dynamic and flexible, as well as reducing bottlenecks and spreading the workload associated with keeping things up to date.

      Although everything on the page is publically visible, it can only be seen by those who either manually type in the page address or have been given the link to it. It is not linked to any of our website pages and it is therefore very unlikey that anyone browsing our site will stumble onto it.
