    <h1>Dummy embedded calendars</h1>
    <!-- <h2>Test/play around with them</h2> -->
    
    <p>
      This page exists for <em class="notice-me">you</em> to experiment with the ways <em class="notice-me">you</em> might <em>view/edit/extract</em> events in embedded calendars.
    <p/>

    <p>
      This is part of a bigger experiment aimed at changing the <em>public facing</em> elements of our website. Including eventually, a complete overhaul of it's <em>look and feel</em>. For the moment, this is all for testing purposes only. It is hosted on the same server as our web site, but it is not linked to any of its pages 
    <p/>

    <p>
      Three calendars are displayed in the date/time grid below.
    <p/>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Two are Google calendars that <em>belong</em> to the <em>'BSUCShared MultiuserAccount'</em> Google account we administer.         They initially contain <em>dummy</em> event information, though this will change over the period of this experiment, such that they may start to reflect real events.
        <p/>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>
          The third belongs to Southampton FC and shows fixture information. It is updated with results by Southampton FC. It was deliberately included for fun and to illustrate the sorts of things that are possible.
        <p/>
      </li>
      
    </ul>

    <p>
      See more info on <em>viewing/editing events</em> the calendars at the bottom of this page, as well as <em>why we are doing this</em>.

    <h1>Viewing events</h1>
    <p>
      Referring to the calendars time/date grid shown above ...
      
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li>
        <p>
          The event text may be too small for some. If so, use the browser's zoom capability. On many PC's/laptops etc. this can be done with the keyboard as follows ...
        </p>
        <pre>
          To zoom in:         Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press '+' key 
          To zoom out:        Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press '-' key 
          To reset to normal: Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press '0' key 
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Click on individual events to find out more about them.
        <p/>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Use the controls shown at the top of the grid above to scan forwards/backwards in time, change the <em>Week </em>, <em>Month</em> and <em>Agenda</em> layouts. Use the  <em>drop down selection</em> list to choose which calendars to hide/display.
        <p/>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p>
          Try to get as far as viewing the document attached to the Nov 1st <em>chtog somerset newsletter</em> event.
        <p/>
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Confusingly, the whole  <em>'BSUCShared MultiuserAccount'</em> Google account is sometimes also referred to by the Gmail address associated with it, namely <em>shaftesburyuc@gmail.com</em> and this email is also used as the name of the default calendar associated with the account.
    <p/>
    


    <h1>Editing events</h1>
    <p>
      We intend to give a number of people the necessary privileges to be able to edit our embedded Google calendars. This would make the sharing of event information more dynamic and flexible, as well as reducing bottlenecks and spreading the workload associated with keeping things up to date. See more on <a href="editingcals.html">editing events</a>.
    <p/>

    <p>
      In order to continue to support those who need/prefer event information presented in documents such as Notices and Clanger, and to avoid creating even more work for those trying to keep everything in sync, an online WebApp tool is available for extracting event details between two user selected dates in a format which can be copied and pasted eleswhere. See more on <a href="extractingfromcals.html">extraction tool</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Why are we doing this?</h1>
    <p>
      This section is a preliminary <em>'have a play with it, see what you think'</em> exercise related to the idea of including an event calendar on a <em>public facing</em> page on the website.
    </p>


    <p>
      Some of the advantages of making event information available in online/embedded calendars are ...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The ability to scan far ahead/behind in time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The distribution of workload associated with maintaining up to date information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
