    <h1>Google calendar event extraction WebApp</h1>

    <p>
      The WebApp extracts event information between two user specified dates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently it only extracts event information from the default calendar owned by the  <em>'BSUCAdmin ForBSUCMultiusers'</em> Google account we administer. This calendar is confusingly referred to by Google as <em>'shaftesburyuc@gmail.com'</em> rather than <em>default</em>.      
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for the WebApp to run to completion, the user has to sign in to a Google account, either before running it or in response to a prompt during the process. Any Google account will do. This is probably because the WebApp runs on Google servers and they want some element of control.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have access to a your own Google account then it's highly recommended to use that. If you don't, then in theory it's possible to sign in to the <em>'BSUCShared MultiuserAccount'</em> Google account that owns the calendar the WebApp is extracting event info from. But think very carefully beforehand about <a href="implicationsofsharing.html">the implications of signing into a shared Google account</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Follow this <a href="http://www.shaftesburyuc.org.uk/test/jquery/drpcal.html">link</a> to see the WebApp. Run it as many times as you like.
