      Currently this tool only extracts event information from the default calendar owned by the  <em>'BSUCAdmin ForBSUCMultiusers'</em> Google account we administer. In the embedded calendars shown <a href="cal.html">here</a>, this calendar is rather confusingly referred to as <em>'shaftesburyuc@gmail.com'</em> rather than <em>default</em> and would typically be the one containing the same kind of event information currently shown in Notices and Clanger documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tool extracts event information between two user specified dates.

    <p>
      In order for the tool to run to completion, the user running it either has to sign in to a Google account during the process, or be signed into a Google account before the tool runs. Any Google account will do. This is probably because the tool runs on Google servers and they want some element of control.

      If you have access to a your own Google account then it's highly recommended to use that. If you don't, then in theory it's possible to login to the <em>'BSUCShared MultiuserAccount'</em> Google account that owns the calendar we are trying to extract event info from. But think very carefully beforehand about <a href="implicationsofsharing.html">the implications of logging into a shared Google account</a>.
