    <h2> General Google account info</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A Google account contains lots of Services/Apps such as YouTube, Drive, Contacts, Maps, Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Photos and lots more. By default, the data and documents created by these apps are private to the Google account containing them and cannot be seen by others.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you have a Gmail email address - <em>@gmail</em> - then you already have your own Google account and access to all the Services/Apps mentioned above.

    <h2> General Google account Calendar App/Service info</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A Google calendar is one in which event details are stored online. Some would call it an online calendar. It is owned by a single Google account.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Google calendars we are discussing are owned by the <em>'BSUCShared MultiuserAccount'</em> Google account.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          An online calendar can be embedded in a web page, where it becomes publically visible - but not editable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In order to edit a Google calendar you must either ...
        </p>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Be signed into the Google account that owns it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Be signed into another Google account that has been granted write access to the given calendar by the Google account that owns it.

      <h2>How do i edit a Google calendar owned by the <em>'BSUCShared MultiuserAccount'</em> Google account?</h2>
    <p>
      You will find lots of general info/help online about the specifics of managing Google calendar events. For example creating recurring events, search filtering, attaching documents from Google Drive, adding reminders, event locations etc etc. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some basic points
    </p>



    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          To change anything, you must first be signed into a Google account.
        </p>
      </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the Google account you are signed into is <em>not</em> the owner of the calendar you want to edit, then you must first get the owning Google account to grant your Google account write privileges.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>



      <ul>        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              In general you would set this up by asking someone who has access to the owning Google account. In this particular case i will setup everyone in BSUC who already has a Google account with write access to the <em>'BSUCShared MultiuserAccount'</em> default calendar, which, slightly confusingly, is referred to as <em>shaftesburyuc@gmail.com</em>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>


      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you do not have access to a Google account, then in theory it's possible to sign in to the <em>'BSUCShared MultiuserAccount'</em> Google account that owns the calendar we are trying to edit. But think very carefully beforehand about <a href="implicationsofsharing.html">the implications of signing into a shared Google account</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>




      
      
      <li>
        <p>
          Open the Google account's Calendar Service/App. That will display a date/time grid with all the calendars that this Google account has access to overlaid on the grid.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Start editing/creating/deleting events in the shaftesburyuc@gmail.com calendar.
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Bearing in mind that this calendar is embedded in a test page on our website, it is publically visible. Please therefore be sensitive to what event information you include, avoiding exposing sensitive information. If you are unsure, then stick to creating completely dummy events. This is just an experiment, Whilst it continues, the calendar shouldn't be interpreed as being accurate.
