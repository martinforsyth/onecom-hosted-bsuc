    <h1>The implications of signing into a shared Google account</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You do not have unique control.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A Google account contains information, data and documents that are by default private to that account. If you share access to the account with others, then when signed in, you can see the info, data and documents that the others generated when they were signed in. In the same way, they can see the info, data and documents you generated when you were signed in. That sharing can be extremely useful, but you should understand the implications of what you're doing before trying it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Even signing out of a Google account does not necessarily remove some of the data that was stored in your browser whilst signed in. Particularly if one of the users chose to sync data across all signed in devices.

        <p>
          Things to consider include ...
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Browser history, bookmarks and saved passwords.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <p>
            Others who sign in will be able to edit/delete information, data and documents that you create in the account.
          </p>
        </li>
        
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Unless you really know what you are doing, it is probably better to avoid sharing a Google account with others, apart from perhaps close family. Consider creating a Google account of your own instead.

          You can avoid the issues associated with sharing access by creating your own Google account here <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp">https://accounts.google.com/SignUp</a>

          <em class="notice-me">But remember, if you have a Gmail address then you already have your own Google account.</em>
