    <h1>The implications of logging into a shared Google account</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You do not have unique control.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A Google account contains information, data and documents that are by default private to that account. If you share access to the account with others, then when signed into the account, you can see the info, data and documents that the others generated when they were signed in.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Even signing out of the account does not necessarily remove some of the data that was stored in your browser whilst signed in. Particularly if one of the users chose to sync data across all signed in devices.
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>
          Things to consider include ...
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Browser history, bookmarks and saved passwords.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <p>
            Others who sign in will be able to edit/delete information, data and documents that you create in the account.
          </p>
        </li>
        
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Unless you really know what you are doing, it is probably better to avoid sharing a Google account with others, apart from perhaps close family. Consider creating a Google account of your own instead.
